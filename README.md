# Image_Segmentation
Partitioning Images into multiple segments to simplify the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.

We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping problem is a clustering problem.
